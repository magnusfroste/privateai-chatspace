It includes all key details from the context: clicking 'Forgot Password', entering email, checking email, and password requirements (8+ characters, one number). The only minor issue is the inclusion of irrelevant context snippets (file upload, GDPR, device specs), which do not affect the core answer but slightly reduce faithfulness due to noise. However, the core answer remains faithful and complete."
