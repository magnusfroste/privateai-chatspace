Cavitation is typically caused by **low pressure in the pump inlet**, leading to vapor bubble formation and collapse, which causes noise, vibration, and impeller damage.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Step-by-Step Cavitation Troubleshooting Guide**\n\n#### **1. Confirm Cavitation Symptoms**\nBefore troubleshooting, verify the issue:\n- **Loud, rattling, or \u201cgravel-like\u201d noise** from the waterjet (especially at low speed/high RPM).\n- **Vibration** transmitted through the hull.\n- **Reduced thrust** or sluggish response.\n- **Visible pitting or erosion** on impeller blades during inspection.\n\n> \ud83d\udccc *Cavitation is NOT caused by debris or mechanical wear \u2014 it is a fluid dynamics issue.*\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Check for High RPM at Low Speed \u2014 Primary Cause**\n> **Probable Cause A (from MJP-4200-WM-PA1, Section 4.1.2 & MJP-5996-SM-A1, Section 6.1.2):**  \n> *Waterjet operated at very high RPM in low speed resulting in pump cavitation.*\n\n##### \u2705 **Action:**\n- **Reduce engine RPM** while maintaining low vessel speed.\n- Avoid \u201crevving\u201d the engine in slow maneuvering (e.g., docking, trolling).\n- Use **throttle modulation** \u2014 increase RPM gradually as speed increases.\n\n> \u2705 **Best Practice**:  \n> Maintain a **minimum vessel speed of 3\u20135 knots** when operating above 70% RPM to prevent inlet pressure drop.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Inspect the Intake and Pump for Obstructions**\n> **Probable Cause B (MJP-4200-WM-PA1, Section 4.1.2; MJP-5996-SM-A1, Section 6.1.2):**  \n> *Debris in intake or pump.*\n\n##### \u2705 **Action:**\n1. **Shut down** the system and secure the vessel.\n2. **Visually inspect** the waterjet intake for:\n   - Seaweed, rope, plastic, or fishing nets\n   - Sand, silt, or mud buildup\n3. **Clean the intake** from top to bottom (see MJP-4200-WM-PA1, Section 3.2.13).\n4. **Inspect impeller** for damage or debris entanglement (Section 3.2.2).\n5. **Remove any obstructions** \u2014 even small debris can disrupt flow.\n\n> \ud83d\udccc *Use only non-metallic tools to avoid scratching the impeller or housing.*\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Check Impeller Blade Tip Clearance**\n> **Probable Cause E (MJP-4200-WM-PA1, Section 4.1.2; MJP-5996-SM-A1, Section 6.1.2):**  \n> *Impeller damage or housing contact.*\n\n##### \u2705 **Action:**\n1. Measure **impeller blade tip clearance** using a feeler gauge.\n2. **Acceptable range**: **0.8 mm to 1.2 mm** (MJP-4200).\n3. If clearance exceeds **1.5 mm**, the impeller is worn and must be replaced.\n4. If blades are **contacting the housing**, inspect for:\n   - Misalignment\n   - Shaft deflection\n   - Bearing wear\n\n> \u2705 **Action**: Replace impeller if worn or damaged \u2014 see Section 3.2.2.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Inspect Shaft Alignment and Bearings**\n> **Probable Cause C & D (MJP-5996-SM-A1, Section 6.1.2):**  \n> *Bearing damage or shafting wear/damage.*\n\n##### \u2705 **Action:**\n1. **Manually rotate** the shaft \u2014 it should turn smoothly with no play or grinding.\n2. Check **intermediate shaft U-joint or CV-joint** for wear (Section 4.2.4).\n3. Inspect **water lubricated bearing** and **thrust bearing** (Section 5.3.7 and 5.3.8).\n4. Replace any worn bearings or shaft components \u2014 misalignment causes uneven flow and cavitation.\n\n---\n\n#### **6. Verify Waterjet Installation and Hull Integration**\n- Ensure the **intake is not too close to the waterline** or located in a turbulent zone (e.g., near hull strakes or rudders).\n- Confirm **intake opening area** is sufficient (\u22651.5x jet diameter above waterline).\n- Avoid **air entrainment** \u2014 check for hull leaks or poorly sealed intake grates.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Final Checklist for Cavitation Resolution**\n\n| Step | Action | Verified? |\n|------|--------|-----------|\n| 1 | Reduced RPM at low speed | \u2610 |\n| 2 | Intake and pump cleaned of debris | \u2610 |\n| 3 | Impeller inspected for damage | \u2610 |\n| 4 | Tip clearance measured (0.8\u20131.2 mm) | \u2610 |\n| 5 | Shaft and bearings checked for wear | \u2610 |\n| 6 | Hull intake geometry verified | \u2610 |\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Conclusion**\nTo troubleshoot cavitation in an MJP waterjet:\n1. **Lower RPM** during low-speed operation.\n2. **Clean the intake** and inspect for debris.\n3. **Check impeller clearance** and condition.\n4. **Inspect shaft alignment and bearings**.\n5. **Verify hull installation** to ensure proper water flow.\n\n> \u2705 **Critical Reminder**:  \n> Cavitation is **not a mechanical failure** \u2014 it is a **fluid dynamics issue** caused by pressure drop. Correcting operational habits and intake conditions is often more effective than replacing parts.\n\nFor full details, refer to:  \n- **MJP-4200-WM-PA1, Section 4.1.2**  \n- **MJP-5996-SM-A1, Section 6.1.2**",

      "answer": "To troubleshoot cavitation in an MJP waterjet system, follow the standardized procedure outlined in the service manuals, which identifies cavitation as a common cause of vibration and performance issues.\n\n### **Symptom: Vibration from Waterjet/Shaftline**  \nCavitation is specifically listed as **Probable Cause A** in the troubleshooting guide for waterjet/shaftline vibration [1][2].\n\n---\n\n### **Probable Cause: Waterjet Operated at Very High RPM in Low Speed Resulting in Pump Cavitation**  \nThis occurs when the waterjet is running at high rotational speed (RPM) while the vessel is moving at low speed, causing insufficient water intake into the pump. The resulting low-pressure zones lead to vapor bubble formation and collapse \u2014 known as cavitation \u2014 which causes noise, vibration, and potential impeller damage [1][2].\n\n---\n\n### **Action: Lower RPM**\n\n1. **Reduce Engine RPM**  \n   - Immediately reduce the throttle or engine speed to lower the waterjet\u2019s RPM.  \n   - Avoid operating at high RPM while the vessel is stationary or moving slowly (e.g., during docking or maneuvering in tight spaces).\n\n2. **Verify Intake Conditions**  \n   - Ensure the waterjet intake is free of debris, seaweed, or obstructions that could restrict flow [1][2].  \n   - Inspect the intake screen or grating per **Section 4.2.2 (MJP-5996)** or **3.2.1 (MJP-4200)** \u2014 \u201cIntake and Pump, Inspect\u201d [1][2].\n\n3. **Check Impeller Clearance**  \n   - Cavitation can be exacerbated by excessive impeller tip clearance.  \n   - Measure impeller blade tip clearance against the pump housing per **Section 4.2.3 (MJP-5996)** or **3.2.2 (MJP-4200)** \u2014 \u201cPump Unit, Inspect Impeller Blade Tip Clearance\u201d [1][2].  \n   - If clearance exceeds 1 mm, repair or replace components as needed [2].\n\n4. **Monitor Operating Profile**  \n   - Train operators to avoid \u201crevving\u201d the engine at low speeds.  \n   - Use the control system to monitor RPM and vessel speed correlation \u2014 modern MJP systems may display real-time data on the jet page [2].\n\n5. **Inspect for Damage**  \n   - If cavitation has been prolonged, inspect the impeller blades and pump housing for pitting or erosion.  \n   - Replace damaged components promptly to prevent further degradation [1][2].\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Notes**\n- Cavitation is **not** caused by low hydraulic pressure or oil issues \u2014 those relate to separate hydraulic faults (e.g., low pressure, high temperature) [2].\n- If lowering RPM does not resolve the vibration, investigate other causes such as bearing damage, shaft misalignment, or impeller imbalance [1][2].\n\n> \u2705 **Best Practice**: Always operate the waterjet within the manufacturer-recommended RPM-to-speed envelope. Consult the **Operations Manual** for optimal performance curves specific to your vessel and waterjet model.\n\nIf the issue persists after following these steps, contact **authorized MJP support** for diagnostic assistance [1].",

The correct torque values for these bolts are specified under **Section 5.2.2: Specifications for Screws with Nordlock Washer**:\n\n| Bolt Size | Torque (A4\u201380) | Torque (A4\u2013100) |\n|-----------|----------------|-----------------|\n| M4        | 2.4 Nm         | 3.7 Nm          |\n| M5        | 4.8 Nm         | 7.3 Nm          |\n| M6        | 8.3 Nm         | 12.5 Nm         |\n| M8        | 20 Nm          | 30 Nm           |\n| M10       | 38 Nm          | 59 Nm           |\n| M12       | 67 Nm          | 102 Nm          |\n| M14       | 107 Nm         | 161 Nm          |\n| M16       | 164 Nm         | 251 Nm          |\n| M18       | 229 Nm         | 347 Nm          |\n| M20       | 321 Nm         | 489 Nm          |\n| M22       | 445 Nm         | 654 Nm          |\n| M24       | 553 Nm         | 842 Nm          |\n| M27       | 805 Nm         | 1235 Nm         |\n| M30       | 1093 Nm        | 1682 Nm         |\n| M33       | 1474 Nm        | 2289 Nm         |\n| M36       | 1902 Nm        | 2931 Nm         |\n| M39       | 2452 Nm        | 3776 Nm         |\n\n> \ud83d\udccc **Note**: Impeller bolts are considered **critical fasteners** in MJP waterjets. Always use **Nordlock washers** in good condition, and apply **MoS\u2082 (Molybdenum Disulfide) anti-seize lubricant** to all threads before tightening [2]. Nordlock washers can be re-tightened up to 5 times before replacement is required [2].\n\n### **Additional Context**\n- The **M12 impeller bolts** are commonly used in many MJP models. For M12 bolts with Nordlock washers and A4-80 material, the correct torque is **67 Nm** [2].\n- If plain washers are used instead of Nordlock (rare for impellers), the torque is significantly lower (e.g., M12 = 60\u201365 Nm for A4-70 lock nuts) [1][2]. However, **impeller assemblies specifically require Nordlock washers** for safety [2].\n\n### **Critical Reminder**\nAlways follow the **exact torque values** specified for your bolt size and grade. Under- or over-torquing can lead to:\n- Bolt failure\n- Impeller loosening\n- Catastrophic waterjet damage\n\nFor full procedures, refer to the **MJP-4200-WM-PA1** or **MJP-5996-SM-A1** Workshop Manual and ensure personnel are trained by Marine Jet Power [2].",

Instead, the article outlines **circumstances under which personal data must be erased** upon request by the data subject, and mandates a **response time of 30 days**.\n\n### \u2705 **Key Requirements of GDPR Article 17:**\n\n#### **When Erasure Must Be Granted:**\nControllers must erase personal data **without undue delay** if **one or more** of the following apply:\n1. The data is **no longer necessary** for the original purpose for which it was collected.\n2. The data subject **withdraws consent** (and no other lawful basis exists).\n3. The data subject **objects to processing** and there are no overriding legitimate grounds.\n4. The data was processed **unlawfully**.\n5. The data must be erased to comply with a **legal obligation**.\n6. The data was collected in relation to the **offer of information society services to a child**.\n\n#### **Response Time:**\n- Controllers must **respond to a request for erasure within 30 days**.\n- This period may be extended by **two further months** if the request is complex or numerous, provided the data subject is informed within one month.\n\n#### **Exceptions (When Erasure Is Not Required):**\nErasure may be **refused** if processing is necessary for:\n- Exercising the right of **freedom of expression and information**\n- Compliance with a **legal obligation**\n- Reasons of **public interest in the area of public health**\n- **Archiving purposes** in the public interest, scientific/historical research, or statistical purposes\n- The establishment, exercise, or defense of **legal claims**\n\n#### **Additional Obligations:**\n- Controllers must **inform other controllers** to whom the data has been disclosed, if requested, to erase any links, copies, or replications.\n- Erasure must be **secure** \u2014 data must be permanently deleted or anonymized, not merely marked for deletion.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Important Clarification:**\nGDPR Article 17 does **not** prescribe how long data should be kept \u2014 it governs **when it must be deleted**.  \nRetention periods are determined by **other laws** (e.g., tax, employment, contract laws) or by **data minimization under Article 5(1)(e)** \u2014 meaning data should be kept **only as long as necessary** for its purpose.\n\n> **Example**:  \n> Marketing data may be retained **until consent is withdrawn** (Article 7), but customer records may be kept for **7 years** under tax law \u2014 even if erasure is requested, unless the 7-year period has expired and no other legal basis exists.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Conclusion:**\nUnder GDPR Article 17, **data must be erased within 30 days** when specific conditions are met \u2014 but **retention periods themselves are governed by other legal bases**, not Article 17.

Instead, it defines circumstances under which data must be erased, regardless of any general retention policy.\n\n### Key Requirements Under GDPR Article 17:\n\n- **Data must be deleted** when one or more of the following conditions apply:\n  - The personal data is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected or processed [1].\n  - The data subject withdraws consent and there is no other legal ground for processing [1].\n  - The data subject objects to the processing and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for continuing it [2].\n  - The data has been unlawfully processed [2].\n  - There is a legal obligation requiring erasure under Union or Member State law [2].\n\n- **Response Time**: Controllers must respond to a valid erasure request **within 30 days** [1][2].\n\n- **Exceptions**: Erasure is not required if processing is necessary for:\n  - Exercising the right of freedom of expression and information [2].\n  - Compliance with a legal obligation (e.g., tax or accounting laws) [1][2].\n  - Reasons of public interest in the area of public health [2].\n  - Archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research, or statistical purposes [2].\n  - The establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims [2].\n\n### Relationship to Data Retention Policies\n\nWhile Article 17 mandates deletion under specific conditions, **data retention periods** are governed by other GDPR principles \u2014 notably **Article 5(1)(e)**, which states that personal data must be kept \u201cfor no longer than is necessary\u201d for the purposes for which it is processed [2].\n\nFor example:\n- Customer records may be retained for **7 years** after the last transaction due to tax/accounting obligations [1].\n- Employee records may be kept for **6 years** after employment ends under employment law [1].\n- Marketing data must be deleted **when consent is withdrawn** \u2014 aligning directly with Article 17 [1].\n\nThus, while Article 17 triggers mandatory deletion upon request under certain conditions, **retention durations themselves are determined by legal bases and necessity**, not by Article 17 directly [1][2].",
